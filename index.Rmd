I am a clinical research psychologist with a background in biostatistics, data science, and psychometrics. At the crux of my research lies the question of what motivates people to make everyday decisions, and how psychiatric symptoms exacerbate known decision-making biases, particularly in terms of risk and loss aversion. 

To answer these questions, I focus on three primary research goals. First, I rely on multimethod experiments that draw not only from experimental psychology, but also from fields as diverse as behavioral economics, neuroscience, physiology, and genetics. Second, I have a passion for psychometrics, stemming from my firm belief that all research findings are contingent on the validity of the constructs we aim to measure -- seemingly obvious in theory, but a surprisingly overlooked area of consideration in applied psychiatric research. Third, I aim to capitalize on methods from data science and machine learning to improve our models of prediction, which has allowed me to gain competencies in R, SPSS, Mplus, MATLAB, and additional programs, along with advanced statistical modeling techniques.

As I complete my PhD in Clinical Psychology, specializing in Quantitative Psychology, I am seeking an industry role on a multidisciplinary team, conducting quantitative research to improve predictions of human behavior.
